The tour was organized by District India.<br /><br />I designed the visual identity and all promotional materials. This included social media creatives, print posters, and merchandise - to reflect her dynamic, cross-cultural energy."

To achieve this I made a distorted portrait and rhythmic line patterns to evoke motion, noise, and feelings of underground electronic culture - blending techno aesthetics with a raw, poster-print edge.<br /><br />I started off with a minimal, vectorized version of her portrait."
