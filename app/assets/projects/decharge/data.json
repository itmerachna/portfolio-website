I led the<br />creative development for this transition and built re-usable visual systems."

Their X presence was bare-bones, featuring only the old logo.<br /><br />With no time to develop a full brand system upfront, it became essential to build one iteratively, day by day. I started with the logo's existing color palette and, within a couple of weeks, established a functional brand system. This system was later expanded and evolved using Midjourney."

While the new branding was exceptionally well executed, it meant rethinking and rebuilding systems entirely within a new set of constraints.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed a challenge, so I leaned into it. The refreshed identity was extremely chic and unmistakably premium, and I wanted to do it justice while still accounting for the speed required to produce daily assets. I returned to Midjourney to develop a new illustration style aligned with this direction.<br /><br />The result was a neo-futuristic illustration style, defined by a modern sheen and minimal elements, designed to scale quickly without compromising on quality."
